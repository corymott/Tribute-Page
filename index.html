In 1894, Ghandi founds the Natal Indian Congress to fight for Indian rights.

      <li><strong>1906-1915</strong> - In 1906, a law was passed in the Transvaal region of South Africa which forced all Indians to register with the provincial governemnt or face severe punishment. Ghandi organized a protest against the new law in which they would all face the punishment together. This became known as <i>satyagraha</i>. This would become a major part of Ghandi's life. Thousands of Indians were punished during these protests.</li>
      <li><strong>1919-1924</strong> - In 1919, Ghandi becomes a leader in the Indian National Congress political party, allowing him to further his influence over the Indian people.

      <li><strong>1931</strong> - Ghandi leads thousands of Indians on a 240-mile march to the ocean to collect their own salt. The marches led to 60,000 people being arrested.
